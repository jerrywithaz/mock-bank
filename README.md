This project is an intentionally frustrating to use bank for scam baiting refund scammers. It looks and operates like a real bank however all of the account information and data is mocked and no transactions are actually happening. It supports several features such as:

1) Adjustable page load times to make the website appear to be extremely slow.
2) Repeatable HTML elements that make it impossible for refund scammers to inspect the page and change html.
3) The ability to set a transparant overlay in order to make it difficult for refund scammers to change html.
4) Annoyingly placed advertisement.
5) The ability to prevent scammers from changing HTML.
6) Adjustable session timeouts to force re-login whenever you want.
7) And so much more!

## How to Use

1) Run `yarn install:all`
2) Run `yarn start`
